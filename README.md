# Class variables editor UI
![example](static/screenshot_1.png)
## Description
This module provides UI for editing class variables through blender UI, as alternative to properties.
Its pretty useless with dicts and lists of generic types though, because there is currntly no option to choose new element type.

Done:
    bool
    int
    float
    str

WIP:
    dict
    list
